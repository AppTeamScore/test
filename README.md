# Canyon / NextChat / Humanitec

This is a lightly-reskinned version of NextChat. It downloads and runs the latest humctl and canyon-cli when the container starts.

It takes as environment variables a HUMANITEC_TOKEN, a GOOGLE_API_KEY, ENABLE_MCP (set this to "TRUE" otherwise the MCP server won't start) and a DEFAULT_MODEL (works with "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25").

Also running on GCP.
